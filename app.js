// 1. Make onkeyup function
// 3. Make variable(var letterPress) that stores letter pressed
// 4. Make a for loop to iterate through each letter of the word
// 5. Use that var letterPress and compare that to letters in word
//     -if letter exists in word, put correct letter in the word on html,
//         -else letter does not exist in word, show "Wrong!" on the screen, put letter under "Wrong Letters guessed"
// 6. after each letter pressed, subtract 1 from total 10 guesses
// 7. Repeat for loop until word is complete
// 8. randomly choose another word in Array
